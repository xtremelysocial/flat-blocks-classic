== How to Use This Child Theme ==

This theme is a standard WordPress "child theme" of Flat Blocks. While you could make edits to it, it is strongly recommended that you create a copy of it in a new directory and update the theme name in style.css. 

The easiest way to do that is to use the [Create Block Theme](https://wordpress.org/plugins/create-block-theme/) plugin.

Install the Create Child Theme plugin 
Use the Full Site Editor to adjust any global styles, templates, template parts, etc. to your liking.
Use the Create Child Theme plugin to export a new child theme based on this one.

You can read more information about how to use child themes on WordPress.org [https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes]

== Changelog ==

= 1.1 =
July 27, 2024

* Breaking change: Changed Background and Foreground colors to Base and Contrast respectively to match the default WordPress TwentyTwentyFour theme. CSS was added for backward-compatibility to this theme's parent, Flat Blocks.
* Updated theme.json to version 3 which allows the new WordPress v6.6 features, such as Block Style Variations. See https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/06/19/theme-json-version-3/
* Simplified theme.json to include ONLY the settings that override the parent theme (Flat Blocks). That includes Typography (font) settings and Custom Templates since this theme's default templates have sidebars, so there are "no sidebar" versions in this theme.

= 1.0.5 = 
February 13, 2024

* Changed Content Page Home Template Part cover image to be an antique typewriter to better reflect the "classic" nature of this theme. Note this requires Flat Blocks parent theme version 1.4.6 or higher.
* In conjunction with above, changed the heading font to Source Serif Pro and the body font to Source Sans Pro. The serif font for the headings is more in line with the antique typewriter and "classic" nature of this theme.
* Set footers to not underline theme link now that the Flat Blocks parent theme defaults to underlining most links.

= 1.0.4 = 
September 21, 2023

* Include full theme.json from parent Flat Blocks theme because WordPress.org theme directory isn't properly combining these theme's json with the parent theme. Note that this shouldn't be needed and if you are making your own child theme you should only need the CustomTemplates section from theme.json.

= 1.0.3 = 
September 16, 2023

* Update screenshot to pass WordPress.org Theme review guidelines.

= 1.0.2 = 
September 10, 2023

* Added "Page Featured Image with Left Sidebar" and "Page Featured Image with Right Sidebar" templates from the Flat Blocks parent theme.

= 1.0.1 = 
September 6, 2023
