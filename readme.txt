This theme is a standard WordPress "child theme" of Flat Blocks. While you could make edits to it, it is strongly recommended that you create a copy of it in a new directory and update the theme name in style.css.

Install the Create Child Theme plugin 
Use the Full Site Editor to adjust any global styles, templates, template parts, etc. to your liking.
Use the Create Child Theme plugin to export a new child theme based on this one.
