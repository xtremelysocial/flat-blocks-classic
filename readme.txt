== How to Use This Child Theme ==

This theme is a standard WordPress "child theme". It comes with a style.css file that you can edit to override the parent theme's CSS or add new CSS styles to use in your content. It also comes with a functions.php file in case you want to override any theme functions. If you want to make changes to any other files from the parent theme, copy the file down to the child theme directory and edit it there.

By using this child theme to customize Flat Blocks, you'll be able to upgrade that theme from WordPress.org to receive bug fixes and new features.

If you make changes to this child theme's Templates or Template Parts, you can also still receive updates from WordPress.org. However, if you change any of the CSS or PHP files, you will lose those changes if you upgrade this child theme.
